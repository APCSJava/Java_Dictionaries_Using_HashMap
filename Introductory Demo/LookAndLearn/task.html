<h1>Dictionaries</h1>
<p>In the casual sense, a dictionary is any structure that creates a mapping from one object to another. The first
    object, called a <b>key</b>, is used to locate a second object, the <b>value</b> of interest.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
    <li>An English language dictionary associates an <b>English word</b> with its <b>definition</b>.
    </li>
    <li> A Spanish-English dictionary
        associates a <b>Spanish word</b> with its <b>English equivalent</b>.
    </li>
    <li> A dictionary of
        postal codes, say used by Google Maps, associates a
        <b>postcode</b> with a <b>street address</b> so that your favorite fast food restaurant
        courier knows
        where to deliver your takeaway.
    </li>
</ul><p>Whenever one object is used to locate another object, the
    concept of a dictionary is in play.</p>

<h2>Dictionaries in Java</h2>
<p> Java provides dictionary behavior through the Map interface. The class java.util.HashMap is the most frequently used
    implementation and the one we will demonstrate here.</p>

<p>Debug the <code>main()</code> method in the file Main.java and notice the effect of the following methods drawn
    from the HashMap API.
    <li><a href="psi_element://java.util.HashMap#put">put(key, value)</a>
<p>If the key is not present, adds it to the map and assigns value.
</p>
<p> If the key is already present, updates the value associated with the key.
</p>
</li>
<li><a href="psi_element://java.util.HashMap#get">get(key)</a>
    <p>Returns the value currently associated with the key.</p></li>
